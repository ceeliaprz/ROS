# PROY_ROS
First, we established and solved the communication between the nodes of the system, designing and implementing the necessary infrastructure for an efficient and synchronised data exchange. 
In the second stage, we focused on integrating and calling a specific service, the mathematical_service. 
In addition, a distributed implementation was carried out, configuring and deploying multiple nodes on different devices to take advantage of the scalability and modularity of ROS2.
